print("Best School")

guillaume@ubuntu:~/py/0x00$ export PYFILE=main.py
guillaume@ubuntu:~/py/0x00$ ./0-run
Best School
guillaume@ubuntu:~/py/0x00$ 
```

1. Run inline
Write a Shell script that runs Python code.
The Python code will be saved in the environment variable ```$PYCODE```

```sh
guillaume@ubuntu:~/py/0x00$ export PYCODE='print(f"Best School: {88+10}")'
guillaume@ubuntu:~/py/0x00$ ./1-run_inline 
Best School: 98
guillaume@ubuntu:~/py/0x00$ 
```

2. Hello, print
Write a Python script that prints exactly ```"Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle```, followed by a new line.
- Use the function ```print```

- You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x00.py/blob/master/6-concat.py)
- You are not allowed to use any loops or conditional statements.
- You have to use the variables ```str1``` and ```str2``` in your new line of code
- Your program should be exactly 5 lines long

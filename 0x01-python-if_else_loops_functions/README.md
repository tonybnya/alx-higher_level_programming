0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing
This program will assign a random signed number to the variable ```number``` each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable ```number``` is positive or negative.
- You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x01.py/blob/master/0-positive_or_negative_py)
- The variable ```number``` will store a different value every time you will run this program
- You donâ€™t have to understand what ```import```, ```random.randint``` do. Please do not touch this code
- The output of the program should be:
	- The number, followed by
		- if the number is greater than 0: ```is positive```
		- if the number is 0: ```is zero```
		- if the number is less than 0: ```is negative```
	- followed by a new line

```sh
